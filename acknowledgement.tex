The completion of this thesis would not have been possible without support and assistance from a number of people. 

I would first and foremost like to thank Prof.~Rupesh Nasre for giving me the opportunity to be able to work on this project. Starting from introducing me to Nvidia's open source project maintainers all the way to reviewing the contents of this thesis, he has been very supportive in all the steps of this project. I am deeply grateful for his guidance and help in this project. 

On Nvidia's side, I would like to thank Mr.~Venkatramana G. and Mr.~Thejaswi N. S. for patiently guiding me through the process of merging my code with the \texttt{cuML} library. The bi-weekly discussions held with them about the code gave me valuable insights into the process of open source development, and made me realize the importance of continuous feedback in long-term projects. 

Finally, I would like to thank all my friends from college, who have made the past $4$ years memorable, and my family for their unconditional love and support.
