  abstract = {Genetic programming is an evolutionary optimization
                 method that produces functional programs to solve a
                 given task. These programs commonly take the form of
                 trees representing LISP s-expressions, and a typical
                 evolutionary run produces a great many of these trees.
                 For this reason, a good tree generation algorithm is
                 very important to genetic programming. This paper
                 presents two new tree-generation algorithms for genetic
                 programming and for strongly-typed genetic programming,
                 a common variant. These algorithms are fast, allow the
                 user to request specific tree sizes, and guarantee
                 probabilities of certain nodes appearing in trees. The
                 paper analyzes these two algorithms and compares them
                 with traditional and recently proposed approaches.},

@book{poli08:fieldguide,
  abstract = {Genetic programming (GP) is a systematic,
                 domain-independent method for getting computers to
                 solve problems automatically starting from a high-level
                 statement of what needs to be done. Using ideas from
                 natural evolution, GP starts from an ooze of random
                 computer programs, and progressively refines them
                 through processes of mutation and sexual recombination,
                 until high-fitness solutions emerge. All this without
                 the user having to know or specify the form or
                 structure of solutions in advance. GP has generated a
                 plethora of human-competitive results and applications,
                 including novel scientific discoveries and patentable
                 inventions.

                 This unique overview of this exciting technique is
                 written by three of the most active scientists in GP.

In this paper we demonstrate the use of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate the evaluation of individuals. We show that for both binary and floating point based data types, it is possible to get speed increases of several hundred times over a typical CPU implementation. This allows for evaluation of many thousands of fitness cases, and hence should enable more ambitious solutions to be evolved using GP.",

Specifically, proportionate reproduction, ranking selection, tournament selection, and Genitor (or ‚Äústeady state‚Äù) selection are compared on the basis of solutions to deterministic difference or differential equations, which are verified through computer simulations. The analysis provides convenient approximate or exact solutions as well as useful convergence time and growth ratio estimates. The paper recommends practical application of the analyses and suggests a number of paths for more detailed analytical investigation of selection techniques.}
